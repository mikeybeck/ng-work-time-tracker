Angular Time Tracker & recorder
====================

### [Demo](http://mikeybeck.com/time-tracker/)

Simple time tracker that makes it easy to record time without hurting the user.  Uses localstorage for data persistence so no database is required.

Built from https://github.com/dmytroyarmak/ng-work-time-tracker / https://github.com/dshahin/ng-work-time-tracker.  Data saved & loaded automatically via localstorage.

To build:

1. clone the project
2. ```npm install``` - install dev dependencies (gulp, etc)
3. ```bower install``` - install front end dependencies
4. ```gulp``` - this will serve your project locally and watch for changes



TODO: 
 - Add total time for each activity to data page
 - Add sub-activities
 - Add better data visualisation (calendar format perhaps)
 - Make properly responsive / mobile friendly

NOTE: I'm really just using this project as a way to help me learn Angular, so expect it to be poorly coded as I have pretty much no idea what I'm doing.
